# Alastria Identity Entity

This is an example of _Entity_ in Alastria. You can try the demo online accessing to [Entity Frontend](http://52.16.248.226/).

This repository contains two main dockers, **entityBackend** and **entityFrontend**.

This is an example of a Entity with Alastria.

## Components

### entityBackend

Backend that interacts with the [Alastria Identity Lib](https://github.com/alastria/alastria-identity-lib). This library interacts with the Smart Contracts from [Alastria](https://github.com/alastria/alastria-identity).

### entityFrontend

Frontend of the Entity.

## How to run the Entity

### Requirements

You need to install [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Install entityFrontend

First of all, you need to install some packages for the Frontend to work. In order to do that, move to the frontend directory `cd entityFrontend`, then:

```sh
npm install
```

After that, build and compile the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Run the Entity

Before running the Entity, you can change the blockchain node IP in the file [docker-compose.yaml](/docker-compose.yaml). At the moment, you can choose one of this (**only one**):

```yaml
- NODE_ENDPOINT=localEndpoint
#- NODE_ENDPOINT=alastria
```

In the example above, a ganache will run locally, so you will need to deploy the _smart contracts_ manually.

Finally, just **run the dockers**. For this step, you need to stay **in the root directory**:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
